### Open Text Editor

There are a number of values that you will be provided or you will create along the way that you will need later on in the lab. For your convenience, we list the most relevant here. It's recommended that you copy this list to a text editor and update the values as you go along. That way, it will be easy to copy them from the text editor when you need them, and especially if you lose your Azure Cloud Shell connection during the lab.

### Access Azure Cloud Shell

For this lab, we will use the lab subscription that was provided and Azure Cloud Shell.

#### Tips for uploading and editing files in Azure Cloud Shell

- You can use `code <file you want to edit>` in Azure Cloud Shell to open the built-in text editor.
- You can upload files to the Azure Cloud Shell by dragging and dropping them
- You can also do a `curl -o filename.ext https://file-url/filename.ext` to download a file from the internet.
