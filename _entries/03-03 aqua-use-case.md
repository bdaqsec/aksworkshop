### Assess Risk

After deployment, Aqua CSP begins to automatically discover your clusters, nodes and workloads, scanning all of them for risks including vulnerabilities, malware, configuration, compliance and more. This information drives Aqua's Risk Explorer, workload monitoring and infrastructure discover views which we'll explore now.

> **Note:** It can take several minutes for Aqua to complete automatic discovery and scanning in your environment (after the Enforcers have been deployed and all capabilities have been enable). This may be a good time to take a short break.

#### View Risk Explorer

{% collapsible %}
Select **Risk Explorer** from the navigation menu on the left.

Aqua's Risk Explorer let's identify vulernable workloads at a glance with color coded controllers/containers based on risk assessment and organized by namespaces, and showing network connections to/from containers:

![Aqua Output](media/aqua/aqua-risk-explorer-1.png)

You can select individual containers to see a risk score based on comparing the vulnerability of the application to its infrastucture:

![Aqua Output](media/aqua/aqua-risk-explorer-2.png)
{% endcollapsible %}

#### View Workloads

{% collapsible %}
Select **Workloads** from the navigation menu on the left.

Aqua provides similar information in a more filterable and tabular view:

![Aqua Output](media/aqua/aqua-workloads-1.png)

You can drill down to containers:

![Aqua Output](media/aqua/aqua-workloads-2.png)

And get a wealth of detailed information about each container:

![Aqua Output](media/aqua/aqua-workloads-3.png)
{% endcollapsible %}

#### View Infrastructure

{% collapsible %}
Select **Infrastructure** from the navigation menu on the left.

Aqua provides even more information through infrastructure discovery of your clusters and nodes:

![Aqua Output](media/aqua/aqua-infrastructure-1.png)

Including KubeHunter API pen testing of your clusters:

![Aqua Output](media/aqua/aqua-infrastructure-2.png)

And including host scanning and assurance with CIS benchmarking testing for Linux, Docker and Kubernetes of your nodes:

![Aqua Output](media/aqua/aqua-infrastructure-3.png)

> **Note** Aqua has a strong tradition of open source for greater transparency and maintainability. Aqua has a seperate open source development team that creates, acquires and maintains several open source projects with and for the community, including KubeHunter, KubeBench, DockerBench, LinuxBench and Trivy (among others). You'll find these open source projects here, https://github.com/aquasecurity.
{% endcollapsible %}

### Image Assurance

Image Assurance is a subsystem of Aqua CSP.  It is responsible for the following:

> * Scanning your images for security issues (including known vulnerabilities, sensitive data, malware, configuration issues, open source software and open source licenses).
> * Comparing scan results to applicable image assurance policies to determine compliance and actions to be taken accordingly (including generating audit events, failing CI/CD pipelines, and marking images as non-compliant).
> * Reporting all security risks found with detailed and actionable information in CI/CD tools, the Aqua web console, and other systems.

#### What is scanned?

Aqua scans images for known vulnerabilities, sensitive data, malware, configuration issues, open source software and open source licenses. Vulnerabilties and malware are identified by Aqua's CyberCenter which aggregates and correlates multiple feeds from the National Vulnerability Database, various vendor advisories, Whitesource for open source, and proprietary research.

Aqua's scanners send this information to the Aqua CyberCenter:

> * Aqua image digest
> * Image operating system
> * List of layer digests in the image
> * List of packages installed in the image, including:
>   * Package format (e.g., rpm, deb, apk)
>   * Package name (e.g., nginx)
>   * Package version
>   * Package hash (if applicable)
> * List of non-package executables, including:
>   * Name of software
>   * Version
>   * CPE
>   * SHA1 hashes of file contents, for purposes of malware identification
> * List of programming-related files (e.g., php, js, jar):
>   * SHA1 hashes of file contents

#### Manually add an image to scan

{% collapsible %}
We will now add an image from the public Docker Hub registry:

> 1. In the Aqua web console, in the navigation menu on the left, click on **Images**.
> 1. In the upper right corner, click on the **Add Images** button.
> 1. In the Search Term field, enter: **jboss/wildfly**
> 1. Click the **Search** button.
> 1. Select the **jboss/wildfly** repository.
> 1. Check the **9.0.2.Final** tag.
> 1. Click the **Add** button.

This is what you should see as you perform the above steps:

![Aqua Output](media/aqua/aqua-add-jboss-wildfly.png)

This will start the scan of the the jboss/wildfy image from Docker Hub. It will not take long to scan the image.  Once finished scanning, feel free to view the results, and see how many vulnerabilities were detected by Aqua.

![Aqua Output](media/aqua/aqua-image-scan-1.png)

Notice how the image is marked as Approved, even though it has many vulnerabilities. This will change later when we apply image assurance policies. 

![Aqua Output](media/aqua/aqua-image-scan-2.png)
{% endcollapsible %}

#### Connect to your Azure container registry

{% collapsible %}
Now we will integrate with your Azure container registry so you can pull in other images that might be on there.

> 1. In the Aqua web console, in the navigation menu on the left, click **System**.
> 1. Click **Integrations**.
> 1. Click the **Add Registry** button.
> 1. In the Registry Name field, enter: **ACR**
> 1. In the Registry Type dropdown list, select: **Azure Container Registry**
> 1. In the Registry URL field, enter the registry domain created by you in this workshop (e.g. https://akschallengeXXXXXXXX.azurecr.io)
> 1. In the Username field, enter the Application/Client ID provided to your for this workshop.
> 1. In the Password field, enter the Application Secret Key provided to your for this workshop.
> 1. Click the **Test Connection** button.
> 1. Click the **OK** button.
> 1. Click the **Save** button.
{% endcollapsible %}

#### Scan an image from your Azure container registry

{% collapsible %}
We have now integrated with your Azure container registry, and you will be able to select it when adding images to Aqua. Let's do that now.

> 1. In the Aqua web console, in the navigation menu on the left, click **Images**.
> 1. In the upper right corner, click on the **Add Images** button.
> 1. In the Registry dropdown list, select: **ACR**
> 1. In the Search Term field, enter: **capture**
> 1. Click the **Search** button.
> 1. Select the **captureorder** repository.
> 1. Select the tag that is not already selected.
> 1. Click the **Add** button.

For this lab, one tag will already have been selected, because Aqua automatically identified and scanned that image for the running captureorder container. The other tag was created by our DevOps project, and was not automatically scanned because it was not deployed.
{% endcollapsible %}

#### Update the default image assurance policy
After Aqua scans an image, it compares the results to all applicable image assurance policies. When a control in an applicable image assurance policy fails, several actions can be taken, including marking the image as non-compliant. Initially, Aqua includes a default image assurance policy that has no controls, so all image scans will pass image assurance, even if they have vulnerabilities.

{% collapsible %}
Let's update the default image assurance policy now:

> 1. In the Aqua web console, in the navigation menu on the left, click **Policies**.
> 1. Click **Assurance Policies**.
> 1. Click the **Default** policy of type **Image**.
> 1. Under Controls, click **Vulnerability Severity**.
> 1. In the Vulnerability Severity control configuration, click **High**.
> 1. Note the actions that will be taken if any control of this policy fail, including marking failed images as non-compliant. This policy will mark any image that contains one or more high severity vulnerabilities as non-compliant.
> 1. Click the **Save** button.

Go back to the Images page, and open the scan results for the jboss/wildfly:9.0.2.Final image that we scanned earlier. Notice how this image is now marked as non-compliant by the Default image assurnace policy, showing which control failed and what actions are needed to make the image compliant:

![Aqua Output](media/aqua/aqua-result-fail-jboss.png)
{% endcollapsible %}

### Runtime Protection

Runtime policies (and image profiles, vulnerability shields and container firewall services) can be used to monitor and enforce controls at runtime, according to your organization's security requirements.

Enforcement can prevent containers that use non-compliant and/or unregistered images from running at all; or enforcement can prevent specific things from happening inside of running containers (e.g. certain executables from running, certain volumes from being mounted, etc.).

#### Update the default runtime policy

{% collapsible %}
Let's update the default container runtime policy now:

> 1. In the Aqua web console, in the navigation menu on the left, click **Policies**.
> 1. Click **Runtime Policies**.
> 1. Click the **Aqua default runtime policy** policy of type **Container**.
> 1. Under Enforcement Mode, click **Enforce**.
> 1. Notice that the default policy already contains some controls, including the **Drift Prevention** control.
> 1. Under Controls, click **Block Unregistered Images**.
> 1. Under Controls, click **Executables Blacklist**.
> 1. In the **Executables Blacklist** control configuration, in the exectuable name field, enter **/bin/date**, and click the **Add** button.
> 1. Click the **Save** button.
> 1. Click **OK** in the Restart Required dialog (the runtime policy will go into effect immediately without having to restart containers, but Aqua will only prevent containers from starting with blacklist volumes during container startup; Aqua will never stop an already running container)

![Aqua Output](media/aqua/aqua-runtime-policy.png)
{% endcollapsible %}

#### Block unregistered images

{% collapsible %}
In your Azure cloud shell, we're going to try to deploy an application.

Run this command to deploy nginx:

```sh
kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:latest
```

This will try to deploy the nginx application, but it will fail due to our runtime policy.

Run this command until the status of the nginx pod reports `RunContainerError`:

```sh
kubectl get pods -w
```

Run this command to get additional details on the pod status (using the full name of the nginx pod output by previous command):

```sh
kubectl describe pod <name>
```

You should see this message under Events:

```text
[Aqua Security] You do not have permission to execute this command. Unregistered image
```

Run this command to delete the nginx deployment:

```sh
kubectl delete deploy nginx
```

Now, let's register the nginx image, so Aqua will allow it to be deployed:

> 1. In the Aqua web console, in the navigation menu on the left, click on **Images**.
> 1. In the upper right corner, click on the **Add Images** button.
> 1. In the Registry dropdown list, select: **Docker Hub**
> 1. In the Search Term field, enter: **nginx**
> 1. Click the **Search** button.
> 1. Select the **nginx** repository.
> 1. Check the **latest** tag.
> 1. Click the **Add** button.

When the nginx:latest image is done scanning, we can try to deploy it again.

Run these commands:

```sh
kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:latest
kubectl get po -w
```

The nginx pod should now be running. 
{% endcollapsible %}

#### Block certain executables from running

{% collapsible %}
Our default runtime policy blacklists the `date` executable. If we exec into the pod, we should not be able to execute the date command. 

Run this command to exec into the nginx container (using the full name of the nginx pod output by previous command):

```sh
kubectl exec -it <name> bash
```

Notice that we are now in the nginx container as the root user (something else that can be prevented by Aqua). As such, there's nothing we should not be able to do. However, if we try executing the `date` executable, we will get a `Permission denied` error message. This is because Aqua blocked that executable from running.

```sh
date
```
{% endcollapsible %}

#### Prevent drift from happening

{% collapsible %}
Our default runtime policy prevents drift. Drift prevention ensures that your containers remain immutable, and protects you from both malicious attacks and bad habits by not allowing executables to run that were not part of the original image and/or not allowing the container to run when image parameters have changed.

To simulate a drift, we will copy an allowed executable, like `ls`, to another name like `list`:

```sh 
    cd /bin
    ls
    cp ls list
```

When we try to run the `list` command, instead of getting a list of the contents of the current directory, we will get a `Permission denied` error message. This is because Aqua considered that new executable to be drift and blocked that executable from running.

```sh 
    list
```
{% endcollapsible %}

#### View audit events

{% collapsible %}
For every event that Aqua detects or prevents during risk assessment and runtime, Aqua generates a detailed audit record that can be viewed on the Audit page (and which can be easily sent to external log collectors via many out-of-the-box integrations):

![Aqua Output](media/aqua/aqua-audit.png)
{% endcollapsible %}

#### Keep exploring!

As you may have gathered when navigating Aqua during the workshop, Aqua has many more capabilities than were explored here, to include image profiles, vulnerability shields, container firewall services, and secrets management.
