This condensed workshop is guided and assumes no prior Kubernetes knowledge.

However, the more complete workshop does assume some prior knowledge of Kubernetes and its concepts. If you are new to Kubernetes, start with the [Kubernetes Learning Path](https://aka.ms/LearnKubernetes) to learn Kubernetes basics, then go through the concepts of [what Kubernetes is and what it isn't](https://aka.ms/k8sLearning).

If you are a more experienced Kubernetes developer or administrator, you may have a look at the [Kubernetes best practices ebook](https://aka.ms/aks/bestpractices).
