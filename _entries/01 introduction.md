Welcome to the Azure Kubernetes & Aqua Security Workshop. In this workshop, you will explore Aqua's security capabilities in an Azure environment with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Container Registry (ACR) and Azure DevOps.

> **Note**: This workshop is based on another workshop, [Azure Kubernetes Service Workshop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/aks-workshop/), that includes much more content meant to be delivered as an onsite and self-paced workshop over a longer period of time (e.g. one to two days). Much of the content has been removed to focus on Aqua's security capabilities in an online and guided workshop over a shorter period of time (e.g. two to three hours).

Some of the things youâ€™ll be going through:

- Creating an AKS cluster (automated for this condensed workshop)
- Creating an ACR registry (automated for this condensed workshop)
- Building CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps and ACR
- Setting up security scans and enforcing security policies using Aqua Cloud-native Security Platform (Aqua CSP)
